# ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
Our project focuses on the classification of text samples into categories of emotion, focusing on anger, joy, and fear. The dataset contains a diverse collection of text samples, each labeled with an emotion it conveys. 
By creating a model that can interpret emotions from text, we can accomplish tasks involving sentiment analysis, emotion classification, customer feedback analysis, social media sentiment monitoring, and other emotion-aware applications. 

# SOURCE FILES:
1. `Data/LSTM` - contains diagrams for LSTM metrics and results
2. `Emotion_classify_Data.csv` - Kaggle dataset containing comments and labels
3. `LSTM_model.py` - contains building, training, and evaluation code for LSTM
4. `LSTM_Terminal Results.txt` - contains results printed to the terminal after running `LSTM_model.py`
5. `FinalProjectSVM.ipynb` - contains building, training, and evaluation code for SVM


# CONTRIBUTIONS:
1. Tiffany oversaw development of LSTM model
2. Anna oversaw development of SVM model
3. Ellie compiled results and managed progress on technical report
4. Yanelly handled outline, content, and delivery of presentation
